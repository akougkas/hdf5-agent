**II. Missing Implementations (Key Functionality)**

- get_dataset_info: Get information about a dataset
- read_dataset_slice: Read a slice of data from a dataset
- get_dataset_attribute: Get an attribute of a dataset
- get_group_attribute: Get an attribute of a group
- get_file_attribute: Get an attribute of an HDF5 file

1.  **Dataset Reading and Summarization:**
    *   **Missing:** The core functionality of reading data from datasets and providing summaries or answers based on the data is absent.  This is the most important missing feature.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Implement the `read_dataset` tool (and potentially a `summarize_dataset` tool).  This will involve:
            *   Adding a Pydantic model for the tool's parameters (e.g., `file_path`, `dataset_path`, `slice_start`, `slice_end`).
            *   Using `h5py` to open the file and dataset, read the data (taking into account the `MAX_SLICE_SIZE` to prevent memory issues), and handle different data types appropriately.
            *   Consider using libraries like NumPy for numerical data manipulation and analysis if summarization is required.
            *   Implement the stubbed out functions for getting dataset info/metadata and implement the caching.
        *   Update `AGENT_PROMPT` to describe the new tools and how they should be used.
        * **Crucially, enforce the `MAX_SLICE_SIZE`:** Add explicit checks and slicing logic to the `read_dataset` tool to ensure that the LLM cannot request more data than allowed.  This is essential for preventing memory exhaustion. Example:

            ```python
            def read_dataset(params: ReadDatasetParameters, directory_path: str) -> str:
                file_path = params.file_path
                if not os.path.isabs(file_path):
                    file_path = os.path.join(directory_path, file_path)

                try:
                    with h5py.File(file_path, 'r') as f:
                        dataset = f[params.dataset_path]
                        #Calculate slice size and check against MAX_SLICE_SIZE
                        requested_size = 1
                        if params.slice_start and params.slice_end:
                          for i in range(len(params.slice_start)):
                            requested_size *= (params.slice_end[i] - params.slice_start[i])
                        if requested_size * dataset.dtype.itemsize > MAX_SLICE_SIZE:
                          return f"Error: Requested slice size exceeds the maximum allowed size ({MAX_SLICE_SIZE} bytes)."

                        data = dataset[params.slice_start:params.slice_end] # Simplified slicing - handle more complex slicing.

                        # Convert data to a string representation (handle different data types)
                        return str(data)

                except h5py.H5Error as e:
                    return f"HDF5 Error: {e}"
                except KeyError as e:
                    return f"Error: Dataset not found: {e}"
            ```

**III. Nice-to-Haves (Enhancements)**

1.  **Dataset Metadata and Caching:**
    *   **Enhancement:**  Implement the `get_dataset_metadata` and `get_dataset_info` functions and apply the `@lru_cache` decorator for caching.  This will improve performance by avoiding repeated reads of metadata from the HDF5 file.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use `h5py`'s API to retrieve attributes, shape, dtype, and other relevant metadata.
        *   Store the metadata in a suitable data structure (e.g., a dictionary or a custom class).
        *   Apply `@lru_cache(maxsize=CACHE_SIZE, typed=False)` to the functions.

2.  **More Detailed Performance Metrics:**
    *   **Enhancement:** Expand the performance tracking to include more granular metrics, such as:
        *   Time spent in each tool function.
        *   Number of calls to each tool.
        *   Average dataset read size.
        *   Number of retries to Ollama.
    *   **Implementation:** Use `time.perf_counter()` or similar to measure time spent in specific code sections and store the results in the `METRICS` dictionary.

3.  **Interactive Mode:**
    *   **Enhancement:** Add an interactive mode where the user can have a continuous conversation with the agent, rather than just single queries.
    *   **Implementation:**  Modify the main loop to allow for multiple user inputs before exiting. Maintain the `prompt_messages` list across interactions.

4. **Progress Indicator for Tool Execution:**
    * **Enhancement:**  Show a progress indicator (using the `rich.progress` library) while tools are being executed, especially for potentially long-running operations like reading large datasets.
    * **Implementation:** Use `progress.track` around the code that interacts with `h5py` within the tool functions.

**IV. Optimizations (Performance & Efficiency)**

1.  **Ollama Client Optimization (Connection Pooling):**
    *   **Optimization:** While the current code creates a new Ollama client connection for each request, consider using connection pooling if you anticipate frequent interactions with Ollama. This might improve performance by reusing existing connections. The `httpx` library, which `ollama` likely uses internally, often supports connection pooling. This might require a slight refactoring of how the `client` is managed.

2.  **Asynchronous Operations (Advanced):**
    *   **Optimization:** For potentially long-running operations (e.g., reading large datasets, calling Ollama), consider using asynchronous operations (e.g., `asyncio` and `aiohttp`) to avoid blocking the main thread.  This is a more advanced optimization and might add complexity to the code.

3.  **HDF5 Data Access Optimization (Chunking):**
    * **Optimization:**  If you need to process very large datasets that don't fit in memory, even with slicing, explore HDF5's chunking capabilities.  This allows you to read and process the data in smaller, manageable chunks.
